# Uni-Manager

A university management application using SQL and PHP.

## Installation

If data is not populated in the database, you can do that by navigating to `includes/` and run the command `php database-handler.php`.
This will create the structure and then individually fill in the tables we have set in `sql_files/create-structure.sql`.
This is assuming `php` is a viable command.
